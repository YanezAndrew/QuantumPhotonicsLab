Uploading my code from the Quantum Foundry Internship Here so it is easier to keep track off!
Here are some plots of the data I took from Electro Optic Modulators. As the temperatures goes from 293K to 4K there is a shift in the I-V curve due to the carrier freeze out that occurs at low temperatures.

# Abstract: **Electro-Optic-Modulators at Cryogenic Temperatures**

Integrated photonics is a growing market that enables the current world-wide data communication network. They have also been shown to have vital roles in the development of quantum technology such as quantum networks and quantum sensing platforms. Satellite-based communication systems are attractive because they have demonstrated the ability for widespread coverage compared to land-based options. Furthermore, satellite-based quantum networking has also been demonstrated as a proof-of-concept. To further scale up this technology, all-on-chip integration of classical and quantum light sources, passive photonic components for data processing, and on-chip detectors are necessary to achieve low size and weight requirements for satellite-based applications of this technology. Here, we characterize a microring resonator-based electro-optic modulator (EOM) as a function of temperature. To investigate the effect of carrier freeze out on the device operation, we perform electrical characterization as we cool the EOM from room temperature down to cryogenic temperatures nearing 4 K. This work outlines the automation and interfacing of electrical characterization tools with a Montana Instruments S200 cryogenic system. The automation of temperature-dependent electrical measurements also finds fruitful applications in the testing of quantum photonic integrated circuits and chip-integrated quantum light sources in the Moody group at UCSB. A current challenge in the progression of quantum photonic technologies is the lack of effective light modulation methods in cryogenic environments, which is required for good quantum circuit operation. The EOMs from Lucidean will be tested and characterized in cryogenic environments, yielding valuable insight into the development of next-generation technologies for satellite-based applications.
